# Specter Start
You use the Specter Start to launch your app.
<br />
To do this you simply type:<br />
```$ specter start app```
(do not type the dollar sign.)<br />

Specter also has a unique system to launch php apps.<br />
```$ specter start server```,<br />
It will prompt you with: ```What port is your server on?```<br />
Here you type in the localhost port (what is after : in localhost url)<br />
From here it will start your app on you localhost apache server.
